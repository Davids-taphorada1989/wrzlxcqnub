Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 iHostage and OMG, what a ride! 🥴 Seriously, I don’t even know where to begin. It’s like they took every hostage   trope, wrapped it up, and then set it on fire with a flamethrower. 

First off, the lead guy, you know the one, can't remember his name right now… anyway, he's trying so hard to be intense, it's almost a workout just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 him. Like, ease up, man, we get it, you're a badass. Did they even give him time to breathe between the dramatic one-liners and gunfights? 😆

> Plus, the plot... don't get me started. It's twisted, but in that predictable way? You know, like when you're looking at layers of rock and you just KNOW which one's gonna crumble first because it's been rained on for years. Natural disasters build suspense better than this script ever could, I swear. 

Have you ever tried to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , and then halfway through you're just like, “Why am I even doing this?” That was me about an hour in. But, I had popcorn, so I stuck with it. Priorities, right?

The villain? Major drama queen. I've seen core samples less predictable than his master plan. 🤷‍♂️ And those negotiation scenes – man, they're like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 two tectonic plates arguing over who gets to be top dog in an earthquake. You just know one's gonna slip at some point.

I bet if the writers had spent a bit more time outside, 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬ing open some good old sedimentary formations, they might’ve learned a thing or two about layers and tension. But nah, let's just make the good guys invincible and the bad guys dumb as rocks. I remember thinking, “Wouldn’t it be more thrilling just to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in reverse?” 

function doNothing() { return null; } // haha random code moment

But yeah, it was kinda fun in a 'so bad it’s entertaining' way, you know what I mean? Anyway, maybe next time they should get a geologist on board. We could turn any script into a natural wonder! 🌋
